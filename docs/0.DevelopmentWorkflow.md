# Development workflow

1. Development of each story happens in standalone git branch (so called "feature branch").
2. Once the story is developed, a Pull Request has to be created and added to the corresponding
story in Pivotal Tracker.
3. Once the story is tested internally and then tested by the client, the story
 gets merged into the `stage` branch. Pull request should be closed.
4. `stage` branch automatically runs tests against recent changes, and if they pass - pushes
 the changes to production & to stage branch of each client. Then tests are executed against
 `stage` branch of every client, and if they pass, the changes get automatically deployed to
 client's production web sites.
