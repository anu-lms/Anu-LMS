- `make cex` - Exports config
- `make en [module_name]` - Download module by composer and enable it.
- `make reinstall` (ri) - Reimport database from stage environment and run updates
- `make db:dump` (dbd) - Create a dump from stage env and place it in /drupal/backup
- `make db:dump:local` (dbdl) - Create a dump from current local env and place it in /drupal/backup
- `make db:import` (dbi) - Import stored database from stage environment
- `make db:import:local` (dbil) - Import stored database from local environment
- `make update` (upd) - Run application updates (composer install, rebuild caches etc.)

- `make tests [folder/testfile.php:testname]` - Run tests

Examples:
```
make tests
make tests frontend/DashboardCest.php:viewDashboard
```

- `make tests:debug` (td) - Run tests for tests within debug group

- `make eslint` (el) - Run JS code analyzer for React app

- `make cscheck [module_name]` - Run Coding standards analizer for Drupal app (check custom modules in /modules/anu folder)

Examples:
```
make cscheck
make cscheck anu_search
```

- `make csfix [module_name]` - Fix Coding standards issues for custom modules within /modules/anu folder

Examples:

**Notes**

- You should define `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ID` in `.env` file to use backups from platform.sh.
- `make` without arguments will run default `up` rule.
- You can also add `alias mk='make'` to ~/.bash_profile (MacOS) to use short `mk` indead of `make`.

## Following sections are outdated and needs to be revisit:
## CLI to work with ReactJS application

To access all `npm` and `yarn` commands you can simply run shell inside of `node` Docker container:

```
docker-compose run node sh
```

Then use `npm` or `yarn` CLI as usual. For example, add a new package:

```
yarn add lodash
```

All you'll need to commit is the change to `package.json` and `package.json` files.


## CLI to work with Drupal application

To access CLI to manage Drupal, run shell inside of `php` Docker container:

```
docker-compose run php sh
```

Then run any command you need. It's possible to use `composer`, `drush`, `drupal`.

If you want to run a single command inside of the container then you don't have to run shell first. Just do it this way:

```
docker-compose run php composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

After that commit resulting `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

Note that Drush and Drupal Console have to be invoked inside of `web` folder, so you'll have to `cd web` first.

Alternatively, you might use the following command to run `drush` or `drupal` CLI outside of Docker container:
 
```
docker-compose run php drush --root="./web/" <COMMAND>
```

If this command seems to be too long to type every time, consider adding it to the list of your bash aliases:
 
```
alias dockerdrush=docker-compose run php drush --root="./web/"
```

Then you'll be able to do something like this:

```
dockerdrush cr
```
