# Getting started with the application

## CLI to work with ReactJS application

To access all `npm` and `yarn` commands you can simply run shell inside of `node` Docker container:

```
docker-compose run node sh
```

Then use `npm` or `yarn` CLI as usual. For example, add a new package:

```
yarn add lodash
```

All you'll need to commit is the change to `package.json` and `package.json` files.


## CLI to work with Drupal application

To access CLI to manage Drupal, run shell inside of `php` Docker container:

```
docker-compose run php sh
```

Then run any command you need. It's possible to use `composer`, `drush`, `drupal`.

If you want to run a single command inside of the container then you don't have to run shell first. Just do it this way:

```
docker-compose run php composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

After that commit resulting `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

Note that Drush and Drupal Console have to be invoked inside of `web` folder, so you'll have to `cd web` first.

Alternatively, you might use the following command to run `drush` or `drupal` CLI outside of Docker container:
 
```
docker-compose run php drush --root="./web/" <COMMAND>
```

If this command seems to be too long to type every time, consider adding it to the list of your bash aliases:
 
```
alias dockerdrush=docker-compose run php drush --root="./web/"
```

Then you'll be able to do something like this:

```
dockerdrush cr
```
