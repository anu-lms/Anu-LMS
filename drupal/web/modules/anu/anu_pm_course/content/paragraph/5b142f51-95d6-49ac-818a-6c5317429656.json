Administrative costs are what is required to keep your project running but are not directly related to your program \u2013 things such as office supplies, utilities, and internet. Fundraising costs are what is required so that you can receive donations \u2013 costs such as creating marketing brochures that you give to potential donors, the costs of an event, or the costs for receiving donations such as credit card processing fees (which usually are 3.5%). Program costs is everything that is directly associated with your program \u2013 your staff, your materials, etc. Take all your costs and list them in order of priority \u2013 what do you absolutely need to have and what is less needed.

In order for your project to be approved by Cultivate, your salaries will need to be appropriate for your community. Costs vary greatly from one country or community to another, so you will need to do good research to find out how much someone should get paid in your community for the responsibilities that they have. You will need to explain in your project proposal how you determined what an appropriate salary is for your project. Our goal is that all of your staff, including you, are given a salary that honors their work, the level of responsibility that they have in their job, and allows them to live in a way that they have sufficient food, a safe home, their children can be educated, and they have sufficient money for things such as medical costs (this is called a livable salary). What you may consider to be a livable salary may be completely different than what someone else in your community considers livable. This is going to be a difficult thing to determine, and it may take years until you are able to raise enough money to reach this level, but we ask that you and your team dedicate yourselves to eventually offering your staff a livable salary.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4.

If you already have a program that has been running for a while, you will have a better understanding of what your costs are and what is a priority. Remember, your budget is simply a plan to help you. You may create a budget for your program that is $5,000 for the year, but the reality is that you may only receive $1,000 in donations. You will only be able to spend the money that you have and will need to make changes to your project to fit the money that you have received.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5.
